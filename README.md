# HMS_map


\textbf{1.} Ecosystems contain many species interacting with each other and the environment. Quantitative understanding of these complex systems is limited by which aspects of the ecosystem can be observed. Often relevant potential variables are left out due to them being unknown or difficult to measure. Empirical dynamic modeling and nonlinear forecasting can be used to infer unobserved ecosystem dynamics with minimal assumptions. Enthusiasm is growing for these methods across a wide range of disciplines.

\textbf{2.} However, as traditionally applied in ecology, EDM assumes that the available time series are observed without error. Failing to account for observation noise strongly biases estimates of Lyapunov exponents and reduces forecast accuracy. To address this limitation, we propose incorporating EDM into a hidden Markov framework and using an iterative scheme based on the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm to obtain filtered state and parameter estimates.

\textbf{3.} We evaluate the performance of this approach on simulated dynamical systems with a range of additive noise levels, as well as on insect population time series.

\textbf{4.} The results demonstrate improved forecast accuracy robust computation of Lyapunov exponents in the presence of observation noise.
